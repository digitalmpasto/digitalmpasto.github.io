## Hi, I'm Tony!

I’m a visual artist and technology enthusiast.

A University of Wisconsin-Whitewater alumni with a bachelor's degree in art, I trained in everything from design and graphic arts, to more traditional art techniques like drawing and oil painting.

Recently, I’ve begun to take a more serious interest in coding, first learning Python, and continuing my journey using technologies such as HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Javascript, and more. There is so much to learn, which is both overwhelming and exciting!

After many months of hard work I’m beginning to catch on and, along with my artistic knowledge, I'm well on the path to creating beautiful, aesthetically pleasing, and functional websites. You can follow my journey into coding [here](http://www.tonyshelton.com/code_journal/).
